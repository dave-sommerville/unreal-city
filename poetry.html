			<h3>Always Passing</h3> 
			<p class="break">I'm always in passing, always passing away.  </p>
			<p>Dancing in worlds of things known and unknown, what could and could never be. </p>
			<p class="break">Waltzing through worlds I created, the worlds that created me.</p>
			<p>Gracefully swaying with them until ruin </p>
			<p class="break">I meant to plant a garden,</p>

			<p>preparing to sow </p>
			<p class="break">But instead I merely plant</p>
			<p>another self six feet below. </p>
			<p class="break">My regrets are a corpse's whisper on the wind. </p>
			<p class="break">I exorcised my devils,</p>
			<p>pinned and placed them</p>
			<p>under glass frames </p>
			<p class="break">I forsook my gods and</p>
			<p>painted Jackson Pollocks</p>
			<p>with my Darling's brains.  </p>
			<p class="break">I've died often enough, the graves I rob are mine </p>
			<p>I have casually set myself</p>
			<p>down on curbs and walked</p>
			<p>away as someone new. </p>
			<p class="break">I wordlessly left my first and second loves and ghosted a</p>
			<p>town a time or two</p>
			<p>I have left so many; so many times.</p>

			<p>
				I wish to be seen, but as a zoo creature is seen. 
			</p>
			<p>
				You may relate to my silly antics, but surely you will never 
				understand me. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I want people to arrive with interest, but be cautioned not to 
				spook me. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Hiding places are readily available and 
				invading my space is seen as act of aggression.

			<h3  class="break">Boxes and Boxes of Me</h3>
			<p>I unpack myself </p>

			<p>I unstitch my atoms </p>
			<p>I pretty up my feelings and give them shape and form </p>
			<p>And box them up so they can't make me feel any more </p>
			<p>Prose to rid me of ideas that hellishly endured</p>
			<p>Even here, words where emotions once stood </p>

			<h3>House with a Leaky Faucet</h3>
			<p>My mind is a house with a leaky faucet </p>
			<p>Or it was. </p>
			<p class="break">
				My mind was a one room house with a faucet leaking moment after moment 
				and there was never a drain. 
			</p>
			<p class="break">
				I furnished my house with special interests and naive aspirations and 
				ignored the water lapping at my ankles.
			</p>
			<p>
				Reflections of the people and locations, my needs and fancies, 
				wallpapered it 
			</p>
			<p>
				My hoarded curiosities and routines brought me more and more stuff as 
				the water left me less and less space 
			</p>
			<p class="break">
				My mind is a labyrinth of the houses it's outgrown like a hermit crab, 
				non-Euclidean, nonsensical, nomadic, trying to outrun the dripdripdrip 
				of living 
			</p>
			<p>
				I can knock down walls, burst doorways and punch holes in the ceilings
			</p>
			<p class="break">I can annex and renovate and decorate </p>
			<p class="break">
				I can construct a web of houses, each with purposeful accommodations, 
				thread together by hallways and secret passages and an ever diminishing 
				sense of identity 
			</p class="break">
			<p>And yet I can never reach outside myself, be more than I am </p>
			<p class="break">
				My mind is a Frankensteinian patchwork of houses, attempting to elude 
				the ocean growing steadily within; storing myself in only the last few 
				floors.
			</p>
			<p class="break">
				As construction continues, I've learned how to live more efficiently;
			</p> 
			<p>how to save and how to say goodbye </p>
			<p>But each lesson came at a cost,</p>
			<p class="break">I've lost keys</p>
			<p>I've set rooms ablaze</p>
			<p>I've barricaded doorways (purposefully or accidentally) with clutter</p>
			<p>I've forgotten whole closets of things in the rush </p>
			<p class="break">Sometimes</p>
			<p>I dive under the relentless deluge and recover my past</p>
			<p class="break">But always</p>
			<p>The water claims house after house</p>
			<p>Knowing one day it will kiss the last ceiling and we'll call it a life. </p>
			<p class="break">My mind is a house with a leaky faucet and I am but the ghost who haunts it. </p>
