# Unreal City
This is very much so a work in progress and I can't pretend to know 
what direction it will head yet. But I can see a bit of a shape for it now. 

I am just beginning my journey as a web developer, but already I see so much potential.
I intend to hone my skills and fill my portfolio with many immaculate and polished
projects. However, I also like to have fun when I'm learning. Unreal City, as it exists 
now, is a grungy playground for me to get curious and little funky with my skills. 

More to come

## Main Edits Needed
- This project is going to begin primarily as a display for my photography 
on my city outings. 
- Collaborators are encouraged, however I need to make something before I can
show it off to people
- I like the banner animation in place of the more tradition hero banner photo
hwowever there arer somethings I would like to change. 
- The title font should be a more typed style, leaning into my web dev side
-Upon scrolling the title will change (Same title, just reapparing from below 
the buildings)
- Below the banner image, I intend to place an explanation of sorts
- This will consist of a fixed background from my photos with a glass morphism
effect applied over the whole panel. 
- I would like to have a night-mode switch here, but one that actually changes
the image behind the glass to a night city photo 
- Then we get to the columns of photos. I want to create a specialty utility
class to allow some photos to span columns
- At the bottom I want to place a call-to-action to attract other artists and 
creators 
- This might be something that I can develop data structure experience with 
- Finally the footer, which will offer my original png plan, which means I have 
to find an appropriate GIF for the background
- I also want to create one-two sub pages. Definitely an about me one, that 
offers some of my other art
- I will also have to decide how I'm going to approach the social media for the
project (and personally)
